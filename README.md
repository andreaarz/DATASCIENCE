# Data Science Projects
Welcome to my Data Science Projects repository! This repository contains a collection of my personal data science projects, where I demonstrate my ability to analyze and extract valuable insights from a variety of datasets. Whether it's predicting housing prices, exploring customer behavior, or analyzing global trends, each project showcases my skills in data manipulation, machine learning, and data visualization.

# What's Inside
In this repository, youâ€™ll find projects that involve using real-world datasets to solve practical problems, create predictions, and derive insights. Each project is designed to showcase my data science process from start to finish:

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Transforming raw data into clean, usable formats, handling missing values, and addressing inconsistencies.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Investigating datasets with visualizations and statistical analysis to identify patterns and relationships.
Modeling & Machine Learning: Implementing various machine learning models such as classification, regression, and clustering to create accurate predictions.
Data Visualization: Presenting findings through compelling and interactive visualizations to effectively communicate insights.

# Featured Projects
1. Housing Price Prediction
Objective: Predict housing prices based on features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and location.
Tech Used: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Key Takeaways: I built a regression model that can predict housing prices with high accuracy. I also performed feature importance analysis to determine which factors most influence prices.
2. Customer Segmentation
Objective: Segment customers based on their purchasing behavior using clustering algorithms.
Tech Used: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Key Takeaways: By applying unsupervised learning techniques like K-means clustering, I was able to create customer profiles that can be used for targeted marketing strategies.
3. COVID-19 Data Analysis
Objective: Analyze COVID-19 case data across multiple regions, visualizing trends and comparing country responses.
Tech Used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly
Key Takeaways: I developed an interactive dashboard to explore global COVID-19 trends and compared the effectiveness of different countries' measures to combat the pandemic.
4. Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Data
Objective: Perform sentiment analysis on Twitter posts to gauge public opinion about specific topics.
Tech Used: Python, Tweepy, NLTK, Scikit-learn
Key Takeaways: I built a machine learning model that classified tweets into positive, negative, and neutral sentiments, helping businesses understand public perception in real-time.
5. Sales Forecasting
Objective: Forecast future sales based on historical data using time series analysis.
Tech Used: Python, Pandas, Statsmodels, Facebook Prophet
Key Takeaways: I used time series models to predict future sales with an emphasis on seasonality and trend analysis, helping businesses make informed inventory decisions.
